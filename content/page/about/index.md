Hi! My name is Katrina. I also go by Kat, and online I go by Kdove.

I am a Cybersecurity student studying for my Bachelors of Science in Cybecurity at Purdue University Global with a focus on software development in Python.

This site is where I'll be putting... well... everything! I want to use it as a knowledge base, as well as a blog and porfolio. Below are going to be some of my links that I think you should be aware of.
